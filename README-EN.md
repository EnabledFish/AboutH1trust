# 🦀️ About Hitrust

[中文](README.md) | **English**

> The Rust programming language has many qualities, but Rust’s greatest strength is the community of people who come together to make working in Rust a rewarding experience.

Hitrust is the Rustacean open source community organisation from Harbin Institute of Technology. So far, Rust has been ranked at the top of *Stack Overflow Developer Survey* Most Loved Languages for five years, with its extremely high performance, excellent reliability, friendly development experience, enthusiastic open source community, it shows everyone a worthy future. There are already many organisations and enterprises starting using Rust in production, such as Mozilla, Dropbox, Figma, Microsoft, PingCAP, Bytedance, npm, and many others. But at the same time, Rust is still a fairly young language that first time was shown in public in June 2010 and released 1.0 in 2015, and its ecosystem is still evolving and maturing. At this point, having more developers in the Rust community would mean richer possibilities and faster development. As Rust enthusiasts, we hope to leverage the collective nature of the school to get more people to know, to learn, and enjoy this language, and be willing to do something for it. Also, this organisation is rallying Rust enthusiasts while also serving as a sort of propaganda for open source. The reason Rust is loved so much today is because of the large open source community and so many developers who work on it. We hope that as you get to know Rust, you will also grow to love open source and be willing to embrace the free and beautiful world of developers.

> Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or garbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages.

Every HITer, if you are interested in operating systems, command-line tools, WebAssembly, distributed systems, databases, blockchain, microservices, edge computing, DevOps, embedded devices, audio and video analytics and transcoding, cryptocurrencies, the Internet of Things, etc., and would like to explore new possibilities, or if you are interested in Functional Programming, Type Theory, etc., and would like to take a practical intro, just join Hitrust and grow with us!

> Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety — enabling you to eliminate many classes of bugs at compile-time.

The origin of the organisation's name: Hit is an acronym for Harbin Institute of Technology, and the t at the end connects with rust to form trust, which is a greeting to a trusted partner and represents the robustness and trustworthiness of the Rust programme; the i evolves into a 1, which is like a dynamic, wind-swept flag and represents the rapid growth and consistent openness of the Rust community.
